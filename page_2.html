<h2>Moveset</h2>
<img class="img2" src="pokemon.jfif" alt="Greninja">
<p>Greninja has a very interesting moveset. It can learn Hydro Pump a special attack that has 110 power but it has 80 accuracy so it will miss 20% of the time. Now you might not think that's too bad but every hit matters in a pokemon battle. Which is why some people would go with the 100% accurate move surf over the 80% accurate move Hydro pump. Greninja is a wtaer and dark type pokemon so it will learn some water and dark type moves. Greninja can even learn moves that aren't water or dark type, like Ice beam or Gunkshot. Due to Greninja beign able to know so many moves some competitive Pokemon players have made diffrent moveset's for example Ocean master with Hydro cannon, Surf, Water shuriken and rain dance. Since there is so many diffrent moveset's greninja has, I added a link to the website where I found the Ocean Master movest.</p>
