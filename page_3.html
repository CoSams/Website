<p>Greninja has 2 (techically 3 but im not going to tell you about battle bond Greninja, because that was event exclusive) abilities. The first ability Greninja has is Torrent. Torrent is the ability that power's up water type moves when the pokemon's HP (Hit Points) is low. this is the most common ability for Greninja to have and it is also the worst ability for Greninja to have. Protean is the best ability for greninja because evreytime Greninja use's a move, it will turn into that moves type. For example: if Greninja use's the move Ice Beam Greninja will turn into an Ice type.</p>
